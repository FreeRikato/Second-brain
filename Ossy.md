Picking an open issue to work upon for an open source project is a tedious task.

Filter open issues -> Go through the title of the issues and pick one -> Understand the issue and try reproducing it 

=> If there exists a PR already for the open issue, get its context and then work 
=> If the issue is too complex then skip to next issue

> What if this is streamlined and automated?
