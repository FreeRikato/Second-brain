# Platforms to apply
1. workatstartup
2. wellfound
3. peerlist
4. hiring.cafe

I have to identify startups/companies that align with my interests and instead of passively applying to them i should either -

1. Contribute if they are open source
2. If not open source, Identify any issues in their product and then reproduce their mvp with the issue resolved

Then, i should do a cold outreach to the CTO or Founder of the startup/company and show them the contribution or the issue i could resolve in their product and how my interests align with the company & i am willing to work as full-time.

Also, being active on X, LinkedIn and Medium could be helpful for me. I have to prepare a blog and video for the work i have done and use the platforms accordingly like:

**X** = Post often about my thoughts on the company along with once a time technical post with the summarized blog (along with link to it) and video
**LinkedIn** = Technical post with the summarized blog (along with link) and the video
**Medium** = Post the blog and use its link in X and LinkedIn
