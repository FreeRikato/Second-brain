| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Query    | READS data from database                        | SELECT in SQL, GET in REST                           |
| Mutation | WRITES/CHANGES data                             | INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in SQL, POST/PUT/DELETE in REST |
| Action   | Runs side effects (API calls, heavy processing) | Backend API endpoints, background jobs               |

| Term       | What It Does                | Analogy                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Schema     | Defines your data structure | TypeScript types, SQL table definitions |
| Document   | A single data record        | A row in SQL table, a JSON object       |
| Index      | Optimizes data lookup speed | SQL indexes, book's table of contents   |
| Collection | Groups similar documents    | A table in SQL                          |

| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| useQuery    | Subscribes to Query functions (auto-updates UI) | React Query's useQuery but auto-synced |
| useMutation | Calls Mutation functions                        | Form submissions, button clicks        |
| useAction   | Calls Action functions                          | API calls, complex operations          |

| Term          | What It Means                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Convex Cloud  | The platform hosting your app (no self-hosting needed)     |
| Deployment    | Instant updates to production (one command)                |
| Reactivity    | UI auto-updates when data changes                          |
| Deterministic | Functions produce same output for same input (predictable) |
| Idempotent    | Running multiple times doesn't cause side effects          |
| Subscription  | Client listens to data changes automatically               |

| Challenge | Why It's Hard |
|-----------|---------------|
| Remote persistence | Data lives somewhere you don't control |
| Asynchronous APIs | Requires async/await, not synchronous access |
| Shared ownership | Others can change data without your knowledge |
| Staleness | Data becomes outdated automatically |

| Code | Meaning      | What It Tells You                    |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 200  | OK           | ✅ Success! Resource loaded perfectly |
| 304  | Not Modified | 🔄 Using cached version (faster!)    |
| 404  | Not Found    | ❌ File doesn't exist on server       |
| 500  | Server Error | 🔥 Something broke on the backend    |

| Protocol | Version  | Why It Matters                                          |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| http/1.1 | HTTP 1.1 | Older, slower (one request at a time per connection)    |
| h2       | HTTP/2   | Modern! Multiplexing = multiple requests simultaneously |
| h3       | HTTP/3   | Cutting-edge! Uses QUIC for even faster performance     |

| Type       | Description      | Examples             |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| document   | Main HTML page   | index.html           |
| script     | JavaScript files | app.js, bundle.js    |
| stylesheet | CSS files        | style.css, theme.css |
| xhr/fetch  | API calls        | api/data, users.json |
| image      | Picture files    | logo.png, hero.jpg   |
| font       | Web fonts        | font.woff2           |

| Benefit | How It's Achieved |
|---------|------------------|
| High Availability | Deploy across multiple AZs—if one fails, others continue |
| Fault Tolerance | Physical separation of AZs reduces disaster risk |
| Low Latency | Edge Locations serve cached content near users |
| Compliance | Choose Regions that meet data residency requirements |


| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Global Service | IAM is universal—not tied to any Region |
| Eventually Consistent | Changes replicate across data centers worldwide |
| Secure by Default | New users have ZERO permissions |
| Root Account | Created with your AWS account; has unrestricted access |
| STS | Security Token Service issues temporary credentials |


| User                                               | Role                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Has permanent credentials (password + access keys) | Has NO credentials                    |
| Represents a person                                | Represents a "situation" or "context" |
| Long-term identity                                 | Temporary identity                    |
| Like an employee badge                             | Like a visitor pass                   |


| Method | Credentials Needed | Best For | Security Level |
|--------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| Management Console | Username + Password + MFA | Humans learning/managing AWS | High (with MFA) |
| AWS CLI | Access Keys + MFA (optional) | Scripts, automation, DevOps | Medium-High |
| AWS SDK | Access Keys or IAM Roles | Applications, microservices | High (with roles) |
| AWS API | Access Keys | Custom integrations | Medium |
| IAM Roles | Temporary credentials | EC2, Lambda, containers | Highest |
| Federation | External identity provider | Enterprise SSO, mobile apps | High |
