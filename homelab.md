Thanks to cloudflare tunnel, i have setup serrver with -

- jellyfin
- ssh
- multiple backend

in my windows laptop. The jellyfin runs on native windows but ssh and the backends run on wsl2 to protect my insanity. Don't ask me why am not running linux all together. Again, protecting my insanity and ADHD towards tinkering and breaking stuff. Will reference my experience and issues that i faced somewhere else.
